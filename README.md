# JavaScript Playground

This repository is a space to practice JavaScript, test small experiments, snippets, and concepts.

## Projects

**GuessNumber** – A number guessing game to practice JavaScript logic and conditionals.  

**PigGame** – A dice game to practice DOM manipulation, events, and game logic.  

**TODO-LIST** – A web-based TODO List built with vanilla JavaScript that allows you to manage tasks, edit them, and track their creation time. Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist across page reloads.

**fetchAPIcountry** – Experiments with fetching data from APIs.
## How to Run
