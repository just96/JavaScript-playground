Vanilla JavaScript TODO List

A simple TODO list web app built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks with timestamps. All tasks are saved in localStorage for persistence.

Features

-Add tasks to the TODO list.

-Edit existing tasks.

-Delete individual tasks.

-Clear the entire list.

-View the creation date and time of each task.

-Real-time clock display.

-Persistent storage using localStorage.

-Alerts for empty or duplicate tasks.

How It Works

-Tasks are stored in two arrays: one for the task text, another for creation dates.

-Data is persisted in localStorage.

-The list updates dynamically whenever a task is added, edited, or deleted.

-Alerts guide the user for empty input, duplicates, or actions like clearing the list.
