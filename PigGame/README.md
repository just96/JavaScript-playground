# PigGame

A fun browser game built in JavaScript: roll the dice, accumulate points, switch players, and try to reach the target score before your opponent.

## 🕹 What it does

- Two players take turns rolling a virtual dice.  
- Each roll adds to the current round score unless you roll a 1, which resets the round and passes turn.  
- You can choose to “Hold” to add round score to your total.  
- First player to reach the target score(100) wins. 
- Demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic in JavaScript (ES6+).

## 🎯 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- HTML + CSS for UI  
- Basic UI logic without frameworks (good for core JS practice)
